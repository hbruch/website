      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re Invited!
We host rotating bi-weekly calls for our users and developers&amp;hellip; and whoever you are. They begin every Monday at 2PM Eastern time. Pop in some time.
We record and post these calls to on YouTube if you ever miss one or want to see what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to.
Using Qri
Using Qri calls are great opportunities to speak directly with the Qri team and fellow users. Share what’s on your mind, learn how to get support for your data work, or learn how to use newly released features.</description>

      <description>Summary:
 Create a clean, reusable qri dataset by scraping data stored in an ugly table. Rerun a script to retrieve updated data (however frequently you like) See and have the code I used to create my dataset, and feel free to fork that code and adapt to your liking.  Look up the latest rankings of MLB home run leaders on baseballreference.com (the authority on MLB stats), and you’ll get a table like this:</description>

      <description>Just a running catalog of media featuring our project and the team leading it.
&amp;ldquo;Where is the Data Bazaar?&amp;rdquo;
At the AWS Popup Loft in NYC, Brendan presented on the origins of the web, document distribution, Qri, and the data bazaar.
 &amp;ldquo;A Better Mousetrap Podcast&amp;rdquo;
During NYC Open Data Week 2019, Brendan and Rico sat down with Marcos Dinnerstein who runs the podcast A Better Mousetrap to discuss the revolutions in open-source, open data, how Qri got its start and where we&amp;rsquo;re headed.</description>

      <description>During NYC Open Data Week, we sat down with Marcos Dinnerstein who runs the A Better Mousetrap podcast to discuss the revolutions in open-source, open data, how Qri got its start and where we&amp;rsquo;re headed. Here&amp;rsquo;s an excerpt:
“In the ‘bazaar’ model of software development, anybody is free to give &amp;amp; take from this code. As we translate this to open data, people are releasing their data, but there’s not as much working together to improve a dataset.</description>

      <title>Introducing Qri</title>
      <link>https://qri.io/blog/introducing_qri/</link>

      <description>I’m delighted to introduce a project a few others and I have been working on for the last few years. It&amp;rsquo;s called Qri (pronounced &amp;ldquo;query&amp;rdquo;. I know, I’m sorry). Qri is about data. Instead of telling you about software, I’d like to start by telling you the story behind why Qri exists.
Two-ish years ago I came across an article in the Washington Post about a group of volunteers getting together for an event at the University of Toronto.</description>

      <title>How We Sped Up Unit Test Performance by 10x at Qri</title>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Dustin, and I work on Qri, helping build our tool for reusable, reproducible, reliable datasets on IPFS. My focus since joining earlier this year has been improving the stability and especially the performance of our application backend. A few months into working on this task, I was especially pained at how slow our entire unit test suite was taking to run - up to nearly 5 minutes on my machine.</description>

      <title>Datasets Are Books, Not Houses</title>

      <description>The world of linked data is built on shaky foundations that prevent a true data commons from emerging. The problem isn’t with the data, but with the way data is linked. Specifically, the way links are addressed.
An address is a uniform, shorthand way of referring to things. Geographic addresses are an obvious example. 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. is the address of the White House. 268 Elizabeth St. is the address of my childhood home.</description>
