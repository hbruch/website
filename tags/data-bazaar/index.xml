      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re Invited!
We host rotating bi-weekly calls for our users and developers&amp;hellip; and whoever you are. They begin every Monday at 2PM Eastern time. Pop in some time.
We record and post these calls to on YouTube if you ever miss one or want to see what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to.
Using Qri
Using Qri calls are great opportunities to speak directly with the Qri team and fellow users. Share what’s on your mind, learn how to get support for your data work, or learn how to use newly released features.</description>
